<h3 class="post-title">Changing the Project Name</h3>

<div class="post">
<p>By default the name of our Gradle project is the name of the directory the project is created in. We can check this by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell;light:true">
$ gradle -r | grep name
name: project
</pre>
<p>The first place we think of to change the project name is <code>build.gradle</code>, because that is also the file we can change for example the version property of our project:</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy;light:true">
name = 'newProjectName'
</pre>
<p>When we run gradle we get an error:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain;light:true">
* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating root project 'project'.
Cause: Cannot set the value of read-only property 'name' on root project 'project'.
</pre>
<p>So what can we do? We must create a file <code>settings.gradle</code> and set the property <code>rootProject.name</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy;light:true">
rootProject.name = 'newProjectName'
</pre>
<p>We can check the name of our project has changed by running the following command again:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell;light:true">
$ gradle -r | grep name
name: newProjectName
</pre
