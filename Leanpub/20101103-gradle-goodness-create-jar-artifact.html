<h3 class="post-title">Create JAR Artifact with Test Code for Java Project</h3>

<div class="post">
<p>Today, during my Gradle session, someone asked how to create a JAR file with the compiled test classes and test resources. I couldn't get the task syntax right at that moment, so when I was at home I had to find out how we can create that JAR file. And it turned out to be very simple:</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy">
apply plugin: 'java'

task testJar(type: Jar) {
    classifier = 'tests'
    from sourceSets.test.classes
}
</pre>
<p>The magic is in the <code>from</code> method where we use <code>sourceSets.test.classes</code>. Because we use <code>sourceSets.test.classes</code> Gradle knows the task <code>testClasses</code> needs to be executed first before the JAR file can be created. And of course the <code>assemble</code> task will pick up this new task of type Jar automatically.</p>
<p>When we run the build we get the following output:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain;light:true">
$ gradle assemble
:compileJava
:processResources
:classes
:jar
:compileTestJava
:processTestResources
:testClasses
:testJar
:assemble
</pre
</div>
