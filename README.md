# Gradle Goodness

The Gradle Goodness series is [a series of blog entries](http://mrhaki.blogspot.com) on Gradle features. And what better way to show a feature than with a code sample. In this repository the samples for the different blog entries are stored.

The directory `Blog/Posts` contains directories for each blog entry. The sample Gradle files are placed inside those directories.

# Author and Origin
