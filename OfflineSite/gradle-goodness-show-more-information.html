<h3 class="post-title">Gradle Goodness: Show More Information About Failed Tests</h3>

<div class="post">
<p>Running tests in Gradle is easy. Normally if one of the tests fails the build fails as well. But we don't see immediately in the command-line output why a test fails. We must first open the generated HTML test report. But there are other ways as well.</p><p>First we create the following sample Gradle build file:</p><pre class="brush:groovy">// File: build.gradle
apply plugin: 'java'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile 'junit:junit:[4,)'
}
</pre><p>And we use the following sample JUnit test class. Notice this test will always fail, which is what we want in this case.</p><pre class="brush:java">// File: src/test/java/com/mrhaki/gradle/SampleTest.java
package com.mrhaki.gradle;

import org.junit.*;

public class SampleTest {

    @Test public void sample() {
        Assert.assertEquals("Gradle is gr8", "Gradle is great");
    }
    
}
</pre><p>To run our test we execute the <code>test</code> task. If we run the task we see in the output on which line the test fails, but we don't see the assertion why it went wrong:</p><pre class="brush:plain;highlight:[9,10]">$ gradle test
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:compileTestJava
:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:testClasses
:test

com.mrhaki.gradle.SampleTest > sample FAILED
    org.junit.ComparisonFailure at SampleTest.java:8

1 test completed, 1 failed
:test FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> There were failing tests. See the report at: file:///Users/mrhaki/Projects/mrhaki.com/blog/posts/samples/gradle/testlogging/build/reports/tests/index.html

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

BUILD FAILED

Total time: 4.904 secs
</pre><p>We can run the <code>test</code> task again, but now set the Gradle logging level to info with the command-line option <code>-i</code> or <code>--info</code>. Now we get the assertion about what went wrong in the output:</p><pre class="brush:plain;highlight:[9,10,11,12,13]">$ gradle test -i

</pre><p>But this still generates a lot of noise. It is better to customize the test logging by configuring the <code>test</code> task. We can configure the logging on different levels. To get the information about the failure we want we only have to change the <code>exceptionFormat</code> property and set the value to <code>full</code>. Our Gradle build file now looks like this:</p><pre class="brush:groovy;highlight:[13]">// File: build.gradle
apply plugin: 'java'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testCompile 'junit:junit:[4,)'
}

test {
    testLogging {
        exceptionFormat = 'full'
    }
}
</pre><p>We can re-run the <code>test</code> task and use the normal logging level, but this time we also get the reason why our test fails, without the extra noise:</p><pre class="brush:plain;highlight:[9,10,11,12,13]">$ gradle test
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
